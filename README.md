# End of Semester Checklist

## Group Projects

### Project 1

#### Slack, VScode, Rstudio, Git, and Github

- [x] Make sure you are in our Slack workspace.
- [x] Finish setting up VScode for programming in R and Python.
- [x] Finish setting up Rstudio.
- [x] Finish installing Git.
- [x] Finish creating your Github account and connecting to our organization.

#### R

- [x] Recreate the two graphics in this repo using `gapminder` dataset from `library(gapminder)` (get them to match as closely as you can).
    - [x] Use `library(tidyverse)` to load ggplot2 and dplyr and the `theme_bw()` to duplicate the first plot.
    - [x] Use `scale_y_continuous(trans = "sqrt")` to get the correct scale on the y-axis.
    - [x] Build weighted average data set using `weighted.mean()` and GDP with `summarise()` and `group_by()` that will be the black continent average line on the second plot.
    - [x] Use `theme_bw()` to duplicate the second plot. You will need to use the new data to make the black lines and dots showing the continent average.
    - [x] Use `ggsave()` and save each plot as a .png with a width of 15 inches.

#### Python

- [x] Recreate the two graphics in this repo using the `gapminder` dataset from `library(gapminder)` (get them to match as closely as you can).
    - [x] Export the data from R and import it into your Python environment. 
    - [x] Use [plotnine](https://plotnine.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) or [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/index.html) to mimic the two graphics as close as possible.
    - [x] Build a weighted average data set using GDP, the black continent average line on the second plot.


### Project 2

- [x] Deliverable 1: Read Python & R
    - [x] Read Chapter 5 Python
    - [x] Read Chapter 7 Python
    - [x] Read Chapter 5 R
    - [x] Read Chapter 7 R
- [x] Deliverable 2:  Decipher R parser script to Python
- [x] Deliverable 3:  Ensure Python parser gives same results as 2016 data from article
- [x] Deliverable 4:  Download 2019 data from CDC (Should have same data in article plus 2017 - 2019 data)
- [x] Deliverable 5:  Add seasons to data (months & season variables)
- [x] Deliverable 6:  Provide a brief summary of the [FiveThirtyEight article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/gun-deaths/).
    - [ ] Create one plot that provides similar insight to their visualization in the article. It does not have to look like theirs. (Cancelled)
    - [x] Write a short paragraph summarizing their article.
- [x] Deliverable 7:  Address the client's need for emphasis areas of their commercials for different seasons of the year.
    - [x] Provide plots that help them know the different potential variables they could address in different seasons (2-4 visualizations)
    - [x] Write a short paragraph describing each image.
